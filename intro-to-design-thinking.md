## Design Thinking

Solving a problem with:

### Empathy / Understand: Identify personas
- start by defining broader themes
- formulate the questions
- prioritise open-ended questions

### Define (what's the problem)
- you need to solve the right problem
- know who are the people the problem belongs to
- define the narrow problem statement: 5cs opportunity identification
    - circumstances: where does the problem arise?
    - constraints: what stops the user solving the problem?
    - context: where does the user meet the problem?
    - criteria: why is it important to them to solve the problem?
    - compensation behaviors: what workaround to the problem do they have?
- create a user-centred problem statement for your persona

### Ideate / Develop
- encourage wild ideas
- go for quantity
- defer judgement
- build on the ideals of others

#### Brainstorming / Ideation session
##### Part I.: generate ideas
S - substitute
C - combine
A - adapt
M - modify
P - put to another use
E - eliminate
R - reverse

##### Part II.: harvest the most valuable ideas and finish it the right way
- make it memorable
- focus on what comes next

### Prototype - thinking with your hands
- mvp
- mock-ups
- paper prototype

### Test / Deliver
- conduct a guerilla test
- don't generate new ideas at this stage, only test what you want to testcodewars


## Frustration and desire motivates purchase and use
### Mental models
- what you think is true, not necessarily what is actually true
- a concept
- allow to predict the results of own actions
- simpler than the things they represent

Goals, needs and mental models = the real hidden story

### Facing change and making good decisions
VUCA challenges - volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous

- look at the context you are trying to solve a problem
- start with observations
- come to the most likely conclusions
- next: deductive reasoning and decision making
- think of the impact of change on individuals
